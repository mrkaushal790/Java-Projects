Integrated real-time transaction summary, including total credit, total debit, credit-debit difference, and cumulative balance.

Designed a clean, user-friendly UI with Bootstrap modals for login, user registration, and transaction input.

Utilized Axios for API communication, ensuring asynchronous data handling and smooth user interaction.

Engineered functionality for adding new users with opening balances and securely storing session details client-side.

Built dynamic tables to display transaction history, leveraging JavaScript for DOM manipulation and state updates.

Ensured code modularity and readability, with clearly separated JavaScript functions and minimal inline logic.
